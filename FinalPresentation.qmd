- Time Frame: 2014 to 2017.
- Data source: Stanford Open Policing Project.

---

## Arrest Rates by Race - Analysis

- Black individuals face higher arrest rates in **every city**.
- Oakland shows the **largest disparity**:
  - Arrest rate for Black individuals nearly **twice** that of the next highest race.
- Hispanic individuals consistently have the **second highest** arrest rates.

---

## Search Rates by Race

---

## Search Rates by Race - Analysis

- Search rates are higher for **Black and Hispanic** individuals across all cities.
- In San Jose:
  - Hispanic search rates sometimes **exceed** those of Black individuals.
  - The gap between Black and Hispanic search rates **narrows**.
- In Oakland and San Francisco:
  - The disparity between Black and Hispanic search rates remains **significant**.

---

## Interpretation of Arrest and Search Rates

### What the Data Suggests

- Black and Hispanic communities experience disproportionately high rates of:
  - Arrests
  - Searches
- This pattern is consistent across major Bay Area and Southern California cities.
- Indicates **persistent racial disparities** in policing practices.

---

## Impact of Police Reforms

### Insights

  - High arrest rates for Black and Hispanic individuals.
  - High search rates for Black and Hispanic individuals.
- Continued efforts are necessary to promote **equitable treatment**.

---

## Conclusion

### Summary Points

- Significant racial disparities exist in arrest and search rates in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose.
- Black and Hispanic populations are disproportionately affected.
- These disparities highlight challenges in achieving fair policing practices.
- Reform must continue in the areas of arresting and searching

---

## Limitations

- Because there were police reforms in both 2016 and 2020...

  It would have been helpful to collect data from the    past couple of years as well to compare.

- In addition, looking at cities in Southern California or a larger city like New York City would have added to the argument for reforms if the search and arrest rates were similar or gone against the argument for reforms.
