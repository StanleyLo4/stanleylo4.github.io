### Overview

- Analyze differences in arrest and search rates by race during police stops.
- Focus on three Bay Area California cities:
  - San Francisco 
  - Oakland 
  - San Jose 
- Time Frame: 2014 to 2017.
- Data source: Stanford Open Policing Project.

## Arrest Rates by Race - Analysis

- Black individuals have the highest number of arrests out of all arrests in **every city**.
- Oakland shows the **largest disparity**:
  - Arrest rate for Black individuals nearly **twice** that of the next highest race.
- Hispanic individuals consistently have the **second highest** arrest rates.

## Search Rates by Race

## Search Rates by Race - Analysis

- Search rates are higher for **Black and Hispanic** individuals across all cities.
- In San Jose:
  - Hispanic search rates sometimes **exceed** those of Black individuals.
  - The gap between Black and Hispanic search rates **narrows**.
- In Oakland and San Francisco:
  - The disparity between Black and Hispanic search rates remains **significant**.

---

## Interpretation of Arrest and Search Rates

### What the Data Suggests

- Out of all arrests, Black and Hispanic people experience high rates of:
  - Arrests
  - Searches
- This pattern is consistent across major Bay Area and Southern California cities.
- Indicates **potential racial disparities** in policing practices if taking a look at proportion of races in each city.

---

### Insights

  - High arrest rates for Black and Hispanic individuals out of all arrests made.
  - High search rates for Black and Hispanic individuals out of all searches made.

---

## Conclusion

### Summary Points

- Potential racial disparities exist in arrest and search rates in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose.
- Black and Hispanic people make up most of the arrest and search rates.
- These disparities highlight potential challenges in achieving fair policing practices.

---

## Limitations

- It would've been helpful to collect data on the demographics of the populations in each city.

- In addition, looking at cities in Southern California or a larger city like New York City would have added to the argument for reforms if the search and arrest rates were similar or gone against the argument for reforms.
